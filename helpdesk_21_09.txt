known obstacles into the RRT 

PI controller 

occupancy grid. we can use RRT library, as this is not what we are tested on. 


for M5, you can teleoperate the robot and freeze the MAP so that SLAM does not change while you go. confirmed 


implentation so that slam knows that you are only rotating when you are rotating. 

phase out operate.py , get level 1 working, M2 code stuff in update_slam. object positions are known so dont need to predict (for M1). 

GET ROBOT POSE, PASS EKF AS ONE OF THE VARIABLES 
ekf, images, drive_measurements, 
pass in aruco detector ?
